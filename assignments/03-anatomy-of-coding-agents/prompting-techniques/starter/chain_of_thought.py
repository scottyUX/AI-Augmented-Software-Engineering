Task: given the refund policy and an order, decide YES or NO. Use chain-of-thought
so the model reasons step by step, but make the FINAL line exactly `DECISION: YES`

Only edit YOUR_SYSTEM_PROMPT.

Check the following three conditions in order:

1. Was the product purchased within 30 days?
2. Is the product unused and in its original condition?
3. Is the product a final-sale item?

For each condition, write the result of your check and a short reason on a separate line.

Use only the provided refund policy and order information. Do not perform any checks or make any assumptions outside the policy.

The final line of your answer must be exactly one of these two options:

DECISION: YES
DECISION: NO

Do not add any other words, explanations, or punctuation to the final decision line.
